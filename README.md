## Project Description
Spaceman is a space-themed adaptation of the classic web-based hangman game. It's a widely enjoyed puzzle game where a ruthless computer conceals a word from a player, and the player tries to guess letter by letter. If the player fails, a hazardous spaceship will be constructed and may harm the planet. If the player wins, humanity survive.
