# Space defender game

### ***Project Description***:
Spaceman is a space-themed adaptation of the classic web-based hangman game. It's a widely enjoyed puzzle game where a ruthless computer conceals a word from a player, and the player tries to guess letter by letter. If the player fails, a hazardous spaceship will be constructed and may harm the planet. If the player wins, humanity survive.

### ***User Stories***: 
- As a player, I want to select the game's level.
- As a player, I want to know my letter guesses, which ones are correct and in the right position, and which ones are incorrect.
- As a player, I want to have a limited number of guessing attempts based on the chosen difficulty level.
- As a player, I want a clear indication of my game progress, such as how many letters of the secret word I've guessed correctly and how many attempts I have left.
- As a player, I want to know when I have won/lost the game.

### ***MVP Goals***:
- Allow player selects the difficulty level. Generate a random word for the player to guess.
- Allow the player to click on the letters (buttons) to guess the hidden word.
- Allow limited number of guessing attempts, with the limit determined by the chosen difficulty level.
- Display a spaceship construction progress when incorrect guesses are made.

### **Level Easy**: 
A guessing word consists around 5-7 letters. A player have more guessing attempts.

### **Level Insane**: 
A guessing word consists more than 10 letters. A player have less guessing attempts. A timer will be displayed.

### ***Stretch Goals***:
- As a developer, I would like to build different levels of difficulty.
- I would like to add the timer to specific level to increase tension and urgency.
- I would like to have the choice to turn music on or off while it plays in the background.
- I would like to offer a player the option to use hints to make the game more accessible.
- I would like to enhance the game's code and experience, making Spaceman more engaging, easy to understand and enjoyable.
